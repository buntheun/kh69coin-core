Kh69coin Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
Kh69coin Core is the original Kh69coin client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Kh69coin transactions (which is currently more than 7 GBs); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Kh69coin Core, visit [kh69coin.org](https://kh69coin.org).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Kh69coin on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/kh69coin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/kh69coind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run kh69coin-qt.exe.

### OS X

Drag Kh69coin-Core to your applications folder, and then run Kh69coin-Core.
